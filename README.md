# Setting up Raspberry Pi-hole DNS ad blocking on Google Wifi

## Setting up Raspberry Pi-hole DNS ad blocking for your entire Google Wifi network by using Pi-hole as the DNS and DHCP server

**Still working on this write up -- it is NOT complete**

I will use this repository to document my process and share my code.

### Assumptions

```sh
This project assumes you are using a Mac OS X system and your network is using Google Wifi router.
```

#### Package Versions

> Pi-hole: v5.1.1
> Raspberry: 4

## Quick start

This project is too early in it's life cycle. There is no quick start yet.

## Prerequisites

You should have a Raspberry Pi assembled and ready for use for ad blocking and as the DHCP server. This means having it in a case that allows you to keep it running "always on" and connected to your router.

I prefer to use the Rasberry Pi 4 kit by CanaKit. The steps should be pretty much the same for any other Raspberry Pi setup (including Raspberry Zero, you should probably get the ethernet module for better connectivity though).

Prepare your machine for development:

### Assemble your Raspberry Pi

```sh

```

### Install Raspberry OS

```sh
edit this part
```

To make sure brew was installed use `brew --version`. To be safe, let's run `brew doctor`.

### Install Raspberry Pi-hole

```sh
edit this part
```

### Setup Google Wifi for Raspberry Pi-hole

edit this part

```sh
edit this part
```

### Connect Raspberry Pi to Google Wifi
